            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <section>
                <p>For my term project in IDM-241, I chose to study and analyze the Google email navigation bar, focusing on its main five controls. I redesigned the side panel, incorporating three primary buttons: Chat, Email, and Meetings. Additionally, I included two supplementary navigation features: the Active Status button and the Help/Support button.</p>
                <p>Here’s a breakdown of each button’s functionality:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Email Button: </strong>Provides users with a view of their email inbox and messages.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Chat Button: </strong>Allows users to access and review previous chat messages.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Meetings Button: </strong>Serves as a hub for online meetings, enabling users to join or schedule meetings.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Active Status Button:</strong></p>Lets users toggle their online status, choosing from modes like Active, Do Not Disturb, and others.</li>
                    <li><p><strong>Support/Help Button:</strong>Offers users assistance by addressing questions or concerns about their email experience.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>I committed to this idea around week three, during the beta phase of the project. Initially, during the alpha phase, I explored a different interaction: the YouTube "like" button. However, I pivoted to this project after realizing that the YouTube video section lacked engaging components to build upon.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <section>
                <p>While building the components for my project, I encountered several challenges, primarily due to my limited experience with CSS. Developing even basic components often required extensive research as I navigated the complexities of web development. One of the most significant hurdles was working with animations. Despite including subtle animations in my project—such as the dropdown effect triggered by the Active Status button—I found the process of implementing them in CSS to be particularly challenging and unintuitive. Another issue I faced involved icons. During the development phase, Google revamped their Google Fonts platform, making significant changes to how icons are integrated. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Previously, the syntax was: </strong><code> < span > class="material-symbols-outlined">videocam  < /span ></code></p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>It was changed to: </strong><code> < span > class="material-icons">video< /span ></code></p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This rebranding resulted in the removal of all documentation related to the material-symbols-outlined class. Although remnants of the old documentation can still be found online, it became increasingly difficult to locate comprehensive explanations or guidelines. As a result, I had to adjust my approach, switch to the new icon integration system, and rethink my styling and animations to accommodate the updated framework.</p>
                <p>These challenges, while frustrating, pushed me to expand my knowledge and problem-solving skills, especially in the areas of CSS animations and icon management.</p>
